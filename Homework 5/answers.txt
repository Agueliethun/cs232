1. The PCB class is defined in calos.py.
2. It contains the state, name of the process, the process id (pid), the process' registers, the length of the quantum, and the memory limits (defined with endpoints mem_high and mem_low).
3. A PCB is created in main.py when the function _load_program is run. It creates the actual PCB within a try catch block on line 179.
4. There are five defined states for a process in CalOS: new, ready, running, waiting, and done.
5. current_proc is a variable defined in the main CalOS class file, calos.py, and it is the PCB of the current process.
6. It creates a mutex lock to protect access and modification of the countdown.
7. When the timer gets to 0, it generates an interrupt within a mutex lock
